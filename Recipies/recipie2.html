         Blend until smooth and set marinade aside.

    <Li>Combine 1/3 cup olive oil, 3 tablespoons lemon juice, lemon zest, 1 teaspoon minced rosemary, 
        1/8 teaspoon red pepper flakes, and a pinch of salt in a jar. Cover and shake the dressing to combine.
         Shake again before using.</Li>
    <Li>Preheat an outdoor grill for medium-high heat and lightly oil the grate.</Li>
    <Li>Remove steak from marinade; scrape off any chunks of marinade. Discard used marinade. 
        Season steak with salt and black pepper.</Li>
    <Li>Place steak on the preheated grill and cook until browned on the outside and red on the inside, about 6 to 8 minutes per side. 
        Place 2 tablespoons of the olive oil-lemon juice dressing in a small bowl. Use rosemary sprig to baste the steak while it cooks. 
        An instant-read thermometer inserted into the center of a steak should read 125 degrees F (52 degrees C) for rare.</Li>
    <Li>Remove steak to a platter and allow to rest about 6 minutes before slicing. Cut in half lengthwise, 
        then into 1/4-inch-thick slices at an angle against the grain. Drizzle with additional dressing.</Li>
